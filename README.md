Browser based Fate Core game manager

Hello there! If you're reading this, that means you're looking through my old programming projects.

This is the Fate Core Blaster, an online, collaborative stat sheet for the tabletop game Fate Core. The idea is that you can call up some friends on skype, open this app, then play through a game of Fate without having to deal with paper to keep track of everything, and without having to worry about distance!

This was a semester project for my high school Web Development class, written on the Meteor.js platform. I'm pretty sure it was taken down due to deprecation a while ago, but if you're still reading this, I may have redeployed it after cleaning it up a bit and making sure it works! If so, there should be a url with the link somewhere around here. If not, I haven't gotten around to it yet, but feel free to look at the html templates and scripting I wrote!
